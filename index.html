            <h1>About Myself</h1>
            <h4>
                My name is Rahul Lal. I'm pursuing a career as a software developer
            </h4>
            <p>
                My career path began in early 2011, the year I started <a
                    href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ncea/">NCEA</a> Level 1 at <a
                    href="https://www.pakuranga.school.nz/" target="_blank">Pakuranga College</a>. I was placed in a
                generic computing course to complete my school timetable. I was amazed by the content that people would
                think they could do in their sleep. This content consists of touch-typing, understandig the Microsoft
                Office Suite, and basic HTML and CSS. I continued to take the classes for my last two years of school.
                That got me to chose to have a career in Information Technology.
                <br><br>
                A few months after graduating from college, I started studying the <a
                    href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/Diploma-in-Software-Development-Level5.html" target="_blank">Diploma in Software Development</a> at <a
                    href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Computer Power Plus</a>. I chose Computer Power Plus as oppose to university, as
                they focus on skill than academics, self-pace & directed learning as oppose to lectures & labs, and to
                build on my current skillset at that time.
                <br><br>
                During my time as a Computer Power Plus student, I learned various programming languages from SQL, Java
                and C#. Other areas such as database development, SDLC, and project management. I also learned things
                outside of my course, such as dressing to impress, finding direction from expierence (in general), and
                other tricks that could help impress an employer. I was also out of comfort zone, surrounded with
                students who are older than me and have expierence.
                <br><br>
                By late July, I had completed my diploma. I didn't decided not to find work immediately, not before I
                gain some work expierence. As a ex-school graduate who completed a IT diploma, finding work will be a
                drag. So gaining prior expierence would expose me to the real-world enviroment, expand my skills,
                connect with other in industry. On my last attempt, I didn't have enough skills to be exposed to
                real-world expierence. So I chose to continue study.
                <br><br>
                On early April, I started studying the <a

                    As part of a school project, I did for my year 12 Computing and Information Technology course. The
                    site is made for a fictionaous martial arts club to help increase the number of members joining.
                    This is done using HTML/CSS, Microsoft Sharepoint Designer, and Adobe Photoshop.

                    perform basic numeric operation such as adding and multiplying of two values. Also it has special
