                        <h4>
                             My name is Rahul Lal. I'm pursuing a career as a software developer
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            My career path began in early 2011, the year I started <a href="http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/qualifications-standards/qualifications/ncea/" >NCEA</a> Level 1 at <a href="https://www.pakuranga.school.nz/" target="_blank">Pakuranga College</a>. I was placed in a generic computing course to complete my school timetable. I was amazed by the content that people would think they could do in their sleep. This content consists of touch-typing, understandig the Microsoft Office Suite, and basic HTML and CSS. I continued to take the classes for my last two years of school. That got me to chose to have a career in Information Technology.
                            <br><br>
                            A few months after graduating from college, I started studying the <a href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Diploma in Software Development</a> at <a href="http://www.computerpowerplus.ac.nz/Diploma-in-Software-Development-Level5.html" target="_blank" >Computer Power Plus</a>. I chose Computer Power Plus as oppose to university, as they focus on skill than academics, self-pace & directed learning as oppose to lectures & labs, and to build on my current skillset at that time. 
                            <br><br>
                            During my time as a Computer Power Plus student, I learned various programming languages from SQL, Java and C#. Other areas such as database development, SDLC, and project management. I also learned things outside of my course, such as dressing to impress, finding direction from expierence (in general), and other tricks that could help impress an employer. I was also out of comfort zone, surrounded with students who are older than me and have expierence.
                            <br><br>
                            By late July, I had completed my diploma. I didn't decided not to find work immediately, not before I gain some work expierence. As a ex-school graduate who completed a IT diploma, finding work will be a drag. So gaining prior expierence would expose me to the real-world enviroment, expand my skills, connect with other in industry. On my last attempt, I didn't have enough skills to be exposed to real-world expierence. So I chose to continue study.
                            <br><br>
                            On early April, I started studying the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5637e700e4b0c91b095e8627/t/56afd3c6b09f95166bbc125b/1454363591703/AMES+Diploma+in+Distributed+Software+Development.pdf" target="_blank">Diploma in Distributed Software Development</a> at <a href="http://www.ames.ac.nz/" target="_blank" >AMES IT</a>.

                            <p>
                                During my secondary studies ,  I have created a website for the Pakuranga Karate Club (dummy club) .  I used <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what%20is%20html" target="_blank">Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) </a> & <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+css" target="_blank">Cascade Style Sheet (CSS)</a> as the languages, I used Sharepoint Designer as the IDE
                                <br><br>
                                Whilst studying at Computer Power Plus I have created a scientific calculator for the Programming Concepts module. <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+java+programming" target="_blank">Java</a> was the language used for this module
                                As part of the <a href="http://msa.ms/">Microsoft Student Accelerator</a>, I was tasked to create an app. My app was a calculator, based on a project I did at Computer Power Plus. This was made using <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+c%23+used+for" target="_blank">C#</a> and developed it on the 2015​ version of <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" >Visual Studio</a>
                            </p>
    
                            <h4>Skills for database development</h4>
                            <p>
                            I have created a database system using Microsoft Access as part of my studies at Computer Power Plus 
                            Programming knowledge of <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+SQL" target=blank>Structured Query Language (SQL)</a>
                            <br><br>
                            My first industry project at AMES IT is a relational database management system (RDBMS)  for McDanny, a fictitious fast food restaurant. I’d create the database using Transact-Structured Query Language (TSQL),  a programming language use to manage the data inside the DBMS, this is also an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) from Microsoft. The integrated development environment (The software of the data creation) used was SQL Server Management Studio 2014, also used Visual Studio Data Tools to create multiple SSIS Packages.

                            Have the abih4ty to communicate well with others. I have attended  communication workshops to get a better understanding of communication and how to effectively transfer that into deah4ng with people<br>

                            At Computer Power Plus I engaged in the Group Development Project where we had to create a training support system for a dummy corporation in the home ware industry
